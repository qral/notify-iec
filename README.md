# 1st nodejs app
Just wanted to try it.

## QUICK START
\# emerge nodejs
$ npm install request
$ npm install cheerio
$ node index.js

## What does it do??

Checking http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/work/iec/index.asp if the IEC program is still CLOSED -> you can not 
register.

After it will be opened - I will receive mail notification.

It runs on Heroku using Sendgrid (email delivery)
