# 1st node.js app
Just wanted to try it.

## QUICK START
\# emerge nodejs  
$ npm install request  
$ npm install cheerio  
$ node index.js  

## What does it do??

Checking http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/work/iec/index.asp if the IEC program is still CLOSED -> you can not 
register.

After IEC will be opened - I will receive mail notification.

It runs on Heroku using Sendgrid (email delivery)
